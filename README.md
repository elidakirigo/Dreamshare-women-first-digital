## API Integrations

-  **The Movie Database (TMDB)**: Fetches "Most Popular Movies" for the "How Dreamshare Works?" section.
-  **User Profile API**: Displays "Most Popular Celebrities" in the "Meet a Partner for Your Best Holiday" section.
-  **Load More Functionality**: Fetches additional movies or celebrities dynamically with a "Load More" button.
-  **Modal Interaction**: "See Other Partners" opens a modal to display other celebrity profiles.
